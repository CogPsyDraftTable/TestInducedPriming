False memory for previously tested items: Investigating test-induced associative and repetition priming

Studying thematically related words produces false memories for non-studied theme words (i.e., DRM effect). Test-induced priming (TIP) is known to increase false-recognition rates when source monitoring is impaired. Our experiments establish the reliability of associative and repetition TIP effects for non-studied lists, which have been inconsistently shown in the literature. In several online experiments, participants encoded words never presented at test. At test, thematically related new words were presented as lures before or after critical category lures. Participants showed reliable false memories for critical lures (E1). TIP effects remained when encoding time increased (E2), when warnings were given (E3 & E4), and when old words from the study phase were included in the test (E6). False-recognition rates were higher for lures primed by repetition rather than association during test (E5 & E6). The role of source-monitoring processes during retrieval in mediating false-recognition from TIP is discussed.
